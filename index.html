            <h3>Introduction</h3>
             <p> TED talks are short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less) from expert speakers around the world. Under the slogan "Idea worth spreading", TED talks cover nearly all topics you can think of: education, business, science, tech, creativity, global issues, and many more. Nowadays TED Talks have successfully spreaded thousands of ideas to billions of people around the globe.</p>

             <p>TED Website uses post-video question to collect audience's reaction towards a talk. At the end of each TED Talk video, user will be prompted to select one option from 14 categories under the question "How would you describe this talk"? These 14 categories are: Beautiful, Courageous, Fascinating, Funny, Informative, Ingenious, Inspiring, Persuasive, Confusing, Longwinded, Obnoxious, Unconvincing, OK, Jaw-dropping. Overtime, the number of "votes" for each category are aggregated as rating. These ratings can reflect <strong>the storytelling style </strong> of a TED Talks. </p>

             <p>Our team got a dataset which contains detailed information about 2550 TED Talks, which includes number of views, number of comments, description, tags, and also rating for each of the 14 categories. We looked into this dataset with specific interest in the 14 ratings and we expect to answer the following questions:</p>

             <ul>
               <li>Which storytelling style can best characterize TED Talk?</li>
               <li>What are the specificity of storytelling styles regarding different topic?</li>
               <li>What storytelling styles are related to more views?</li>
               <li>What are the correlation bewteen different storytelling styles?</li>
             </ul>

            <h3>I. TED Talks are inspiring and Informative in general</h3>
            <p>As mentioned above, TED Talks covers a variety of topics and are given by people around the world. However, is there anything common in their style and spirit? We ask ourselves the question: Among the 14 categories, which of them can best characterize TED Talk in general?</p>

            <p>We looked at this question in two different approaches. First, we summed up rating for each category and created a bar chart (Figure 2). We can see that "Inspiring", "Informative", and "Fascinating" are the top 3 categories that are rated high. </p>

            <p>Then, to answer questions like "How many TED talks are mainly Inspiring?", we aggregated the number of talks with each category as "main rating" and created a bubble chart (Figure 3). The three biggest circles are "Inspiring", "Informative", and "Fascinating", which means these are the top categories that TED Talks mainly rated as. </p>

            <p>From the two charts, we can say in general, TED Talks are inspiring, informative and fascinating. </p>

                <h3>II. TED Talk Storytelling style and topics</h3>
                <p>In general, TED Talks are inspiring and informative. But is it true for talks under all topics? To answer this question, we constructed this interactive small multiple chart where user can select a topic and look at 6 top talks under that topic. For each talk, the bar chart shows the rating from highest to lowest. Looking at the top rating categories for each talk, we had some interesting discovery.</p>

                <p>While "Inspiring", "Informative" and "Fascinating" are common in all topics, we did find some patterns of rating categories related to topics.</p>


                <p>First, for the top talks related to new Tech, they are often rated high on "Informative". For instance, "3d printing" and "robot". </p>

                <p>Second, for top talks related to social issues, they are often rated high on Persuasive and Courageous.</p>

                <p>Third, when it comes to talks related to art and music, they are often rated high on Beautiful. </p>

                <p>We also found that for some serious topics that might not be eye-catching, for instance, alternative technology, the top talks are high on "Funny", "Jaw Dropping" and "Ingenious". </p>

                <h3>III. Correlation between different storytelling styles & correlation bewteen storytelling style and view</h3>
                <p> The correlation heatmap here shows the relationship between different ratings and also the number of views. If the correlation bewteen two ratings is high (encoded by ), it indicates that talks which gets higher rating on one is also likely to get high rating on the other, and vice versa; If the correlation between one rating and the view is high, it indicates that the video who gets high rating on one category is likely to get higher views, and vice versa. We observed the correlation heatmap and had some insights. </p>

                <p> Fascinating, Informative, and Inspiring have high correlations with the number of views: talks that are fascinating / informative and inspiring are more likely to have higher views. </p>

                <p>On the contrary ratings Obnoxious and Unconvincing have relatively lower correlations with the number of views. This may reflect the fact that talks getting more these two ratings are less likely to get high view. </p>

                <p>More interesting facts can be found in this heat map. For example, the correlation between Informative and Persuasive is quite high! A talk that is informative is also likely to be persuasive. Also for Jaw dropping and Long winded, this combination has a really low correlation, from which we can infer that jaw dropping TED talks tend to be short and long TED talks are less likely to have jaw dropping effect.</p>

       <h3>IV. Comparing two storytelling styles: which one is more related to talks with higher views?</h3>


       <p> Now that we have a general idea of TED storytelling styles, let's have a closer look by comparing two of them at a time. Given two storytelling style (rating category), which one is related with more views?</p>

       <p>We constructed some bivariate scatterplot. The two axis each represents a rating category, and the color of the dot represents the number of views (blue being low and red being high). The scatterplot tells not only the distribution of the talks between two rating categories but also help us compare the relationship between the two rating categories and views.</p>

                <h5>"Funny" vs "Inspiring": Funny might be a new oppotunity</h5>
                <p>We can see a lot of talks are rated high on "Inspiring" compared to "Funny". Most talks are relatively low on "Funny". However, two of the most viewed videos (red dot) are high on "Funny".</p>
            </div>
            <div class="one-half column">
                <h5>"Beautiful" vs "Informative": Informative wins!</h5>
                <p>From the distribution, a lot more TED talks are rated high on "Informative". The red dots appear around the higher part of "Informative" but not on "Beautiful". Compared to "Beautiful","Informative" talks are more in quantity and have higher views. </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p> TED talks are influential videos from expert speakers on technology, entertainment, design, science, business and a variety of topics, with subtitles in over 100 languages. On TED's official website, audience can review and see ratings for each talk. In this information visualization project, we have analyzed a dataset of 2550 TED talks and gotten some insights on how does the rating system work and the relation between a talk's views and ratings. </p>
